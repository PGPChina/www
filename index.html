      <h3 class="w-100">Welcome to PGP China</h3>
      <p>PGP China will be the first precision medicine project in China that will use an
	open science approach to break down traditional barriers that slow scientific progress.</p>

      <p>A cornerstone of all scientific research is open sharing of raw data along with any
	scientific conclusions. This is necessary for independent verification and reproducibility.</p>

      <p>PGP China will provide a platform that allows individuals to donate their own personal
	genomic and health status data for the benefit of scientific researchers everywhere.  In
	this way, PGP China will provide large standardized data sets and biomedical resources for
	scientific research that is open to all researchers.</p>

      <p>By enrolling, participants will have a unique experience to directly engage with the
	research community, creating benefits for public health, and helping to drive future scientific research.</p>

      <h3 class="w-100">How can I participate?</h3>
      <P>Enrollment has not yet begun. If you are interested in being contacted for enrollment in the
	future, please provide your contact information below.</p>

      <h3 class="w-100">What is the <a href="http://personalgenomes.org">Global Personal Genome Project</a> (PGP)?</h3>
      <P>Like other international PGP efforts, PGP China is modeled after the <a href="https://pgp.med.harvard.edu">
	  Harvard Personal Genome Project</a>.</p>

      <p>This first Personal Genome Project (PGP) was initiated in 2005 out of the laboratory of
	Dr. George Church at Harvard Medical School. Sharing data is absolutely critical to
	scientific progress, but has been hampered by traditional research practices.
	The PGP approach is to invite willing participants to publicly share their personal
	data for the greater good. The PGP is now a coalition of projects across the world
	with different investigators in charge of different PGP projects. </p>
